I need help decluttering my project by identifying and removing **duplicate, redundant, and unused files** without affecting the website's structure, design, or functionality. The project structure is provided below. The task is to:

1. **Identify Duplicates**: 
   - Scan for files with identical or near-identical content (e.g., duplicate images, scripts, components).
   - Keep the most relevant file based on usage, updates, and dependencies.

2. **Find Unused Files**: 
   - Detect files that are not referenced anywhere in the codebase (unused components, assets, hooks, etc.).
   - Safely delete files with no dependencies or usage.

3. **Ensure Integrity**:
   - Only remove files that do not affect the design, logic, or build of the website.
   - Automate the deletion of unused or redundant files but validate their relevance first.

4. **Report**:
   - Provide a summary of duplicates, unused files, and deletions.
   - Automatically delete validated files.
