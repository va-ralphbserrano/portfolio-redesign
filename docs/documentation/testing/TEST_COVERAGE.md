# Test Coverage Configuration and Requirements

## Overview
This document outlines the test coverage requirements, configuration, and reporting setup for the portfolio website project.

## Coverage Requirements

### Minimum Coverage Thresholds
As per Rule 2 (Quality Assurance Protocol):
- Statements: 85%
- Branches: 80%
- Functions: 90%
- Lines: 85%

### Coverage Scope
- **Include**:
  - `/src/components/` - All UI components
  - `/src/services/` - Service implementations
  - `/src/hooks/` - Custom React hooks
  - `/src/utils/` - Utility functions
  - `/src/providers/` - Service providers
  - `/src/context/` - React context providers

- **Exclude**:
  - Test files
  - Configuration files
  - Build scripts
  - Documentation
  - Generated files

## Coverage Tools

### Primary Tools
1. Vitest with v8 coverage provider
2. Istanbul/NYC for detailed reports
3. Web Test Runner for component coverage

### Report Types
1. Text summary (CLI output)
2. HTML report (detailed visualization)
3. LCOV report (CI/CD integration)
4. JSON report (data processing)

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Configuration Updates
```typescript
// vitest.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    coverage: {
      provider: 'v8',
      reporter: ['text', 'html', 'lcov', 'json'],
      exclude: [
        'coverage/**',
        'dist/**',
        '**/[.]**',
        'packages/*/test?(s)/**',
        '**/*.d.ts',
        '**/virtual:*',
        '**/__mocks__/*',
        '**/node_modules/**'
      ],
      thresholds: {
        statements: 85,
        branches: 80,
        functions: 90,
        lines: 85
      }
    }
  }
});
```

### 2. CI/CD Integration
```yaml
# Coverage check step
- name: Check Coverage
  run: npm run test:coverage:check

# Coverage report upload
- name: Upload Coverage
  uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
  with:
    files: ./coverage/lcov.info
    fail_ci_if_error: true
```

### 3. Report Generation
- Generate reports after each test run
- Store historical data for trend analysis
- Integrate with monitoring dashboard

## Monitoring and Reporting

### Dashboard Integration
1. Coverage metrics displayed in monitoring UI
2. Historical trend visualization
3. Per-component coverage breakdown
4. Failed coverage alerts

### Regular Review Process
1. Weekly coverage report review
2. Identify coverage gaps
3. Plan coverage improvements
4. Update documentation

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
1. Update coverage thresholds as needed
2. Review exclusion patterns
3. Verify report accuracy
4. Clean up coverage artifacts

### Troubleshooting
1. Handle false positives
2. Debug coverage collection issues
3. Resolve CI/CD integration problems
