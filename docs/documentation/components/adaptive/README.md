# Adaptive UI Components Documentation

## Overview
This documentation outlines the Adaptive UI Components that enhance the responsive features of the portfolio website. These components dynamically adjust their behavior and appearance based on device capabilities, viewport size, and user preferences.

## Component Structure
All adaptive components are located in `/src/components/adaptive/` and follow a consistent pattern:
- TypeScript/React implementation
- Styled-components for dynamic styling
- Jest/React Testing Library test suite
- Storybook documentation

## Components

### 1. ResponsiveContainer
A smart container that handles responsive layouts and maintains optimal content width across devices.

**Props Interface:**
```typescript
interface ResponsiveContainerProps {
  maxWidth?: string;
  padding?: string;
  breakpoints?: {
    mobile: string;
    tablet: string;
    desktop: string;
  };
  children: React.ReactNode;
}
```

**Performance Metrics:**
- Bundle size: < 10KB
- Render time: < 50ms
- No layout shifts (CLS: 0)

### 2. AdaptiveImage
An image component that automatically handles responsive image loading and optimization.

**Props Interface:**
```typescript
interface AdaptiveImageProps {
  src: string;
  alt: string;
  sizes?: string;
  loading?: 'lazy' | 'eager';
  quality?: number;
  placeholder?: 'blur' | 'empty';
}
```

**Performance Metrics:**
- Supports WebP format
- Automatic lazy loading
- Progressive loading with blur placeholder
- Max initial load size: 50KB

### 3. AdaptiveGrid
A responsive grid system that adjusts columns and spacing based on viewport.

**Props Interface:**
```typescript
interface AdaptiveGridProps {
  columns: {
    mobile: number;
    tablet: number;
    desktop: number;
  };
  gap: string;
  children: React.ReactNode;
}
```

**Performance Metrics:**
- CSS Grid-based implementation
- No JS-based calculations for layout
- Zero layout shifts during resize

## Implementation Guidelines

### Performance Standards (Rule 3)
- All components must meet the following metrics:
  - First Contentful Paint (FCP) < 1.5s
  - Time to Interactive (TTI) < 2.5s
  - Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) < 2s
  - Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) < 0.1

### Quality Assurance (Rule 2)
Required test coverage:
- Unit tests: 100% coverage
- Integration tests: Key user flows
- E2E tests: Critical paths
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Performance tests: Lighthouse CI

### Security Considerations
- No client-side storage of sensitive data
- Sanitized prop inputs
- CSP-compliant implementations
- Regular security audits

## Development Workflow (Rule 4)
1. Create feature branch: `feature/adaptive-[component-name]`
2. Implement component following TypeScript guidelines
3. Add comprehensive tests
4. Create Storybook documentation
5. Submit PR for review
6. Deploy to staging for testing
7. Merge to main after approval

## Version Control
- Follow conventional commits
- Required PR reviews: 2
- Automated testing in CI pipeline
- Staged deployments
