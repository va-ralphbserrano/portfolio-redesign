 Task: Fix **TypeScript type errors** in my project to align with **GitHub-approved standards**. Follow these instructions **strictly**: 

1. Run Type Checking:  
   - Start by running `npm run build` to identify all TypeScript type errors in the project.  
   - Use the error messages to guide your fixes systematically.

2. Fix Only Type Errors:  
   - Address **type-related issues only**, such as:  
     - Type mismatches.  
     - Missing or incorrect return types.  
     - Incorrect parameter types.  
     - Redundant or improper `any` usage.  
   - **Do not modify any logic, design, layout, functionality, or other non-type-related code.**  

3. Preserve Code Integrity:  
   - Maintain the original file structure, formatting, and organization.  
   - Avoid introducing unrelated changes, including stylistic edits, refactoring, or additions to functionality.  

4. Adhere to GitHub Standards:  
   - Ensure the code follows best practices for maintainability and readability.  
   - Use TypeScript's strict mode features to enforce type safety, where applicable.  
   - Document complex fixes using concise and meaningful comments.  

5. Verification and Testing:  
   - After applying fixes, rerun `npm run build` to confirm all type errors are resolved.  
   - If any errors persist, continue addressing them until the project builds successfully without errors.  

6. Strict Compliance:  
   - Do not make changes outside the scope of type error resolution.  
   - Avoid creating new files unless explicitly required by the type fixes. Search the existing source code thoroughly before considering new files.  

7. Deliverables:  
   - Provide a clear summary of the fixes in the following format:  
     - **Files Modified**: List of updated files.  
     - **Original Type Error**: Brief description of the error.  
     - **Resolution**: Specific change made to fix the error.  
   - Ensure that your summary is concise and formatted for easy review in a GitHub pull request.
