Focus: Implementing Window object stability fixes with enhanced event handling

Changes Made:
1. Prototype Chain Enhancement:
   - Created proper prototype chain inheriting from EventTarget
   - Implemented property descriptor handling
   - Added constructor checks for prototype safety
   - Impact: Partial success, but inheritance still not working correctly

2. Event System Improvements:
   - Rewrote event method aliases (on, off, emit)
   - Added event handler wrapping for proper data handling
   - Implemented event listener tracking system
   - Impact: Event handling still failing with type errors

3. Verification System:
   - Enhanced verification checks
   - Added end-to-end event system testing
   - Impact: Tests revealed multiple issues

Results:
- Window prototype chain integrity test failing
- Event handling tests failing with type errors
- Component tests failing due to event system issues
- Multiple unhandled rejections in event handling

Analysis:
1. Prototype Chain Issues:
   - Window not properly inheriting from EventTarget
   - Prototype chain verification failing
   - Constructor handling needs revision

2. Event System Issues:
   - Event creation and dispatch failing
   - Type errors in event parameter handling
   - Event listener management not working

3. Component Integration:
   - AdaptiveImage component failing due to event system
   - ResponsiveImage tests failing with event errors
   - SmartLayout tests failing with render issues

Next Steps:
1. Fix Window prototype chain to properly inherit from EventTarget
2. Revise event creation and dispatch mechanism
3. Update event listener tracking system
4. Fix component integration with event system
5. Add more robust error handling for event operations
