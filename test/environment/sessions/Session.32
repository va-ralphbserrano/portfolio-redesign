Status: IN_PROGRESS

Focus: Investigating Window object prototype chain issue

Changes Made:
1. Diagnostic Implementation:
   - Created C001-prototype-chain.test.js
   - Added detailed prototype chain inspection
   - Implemented EventTarget verification tests
   - Impact: Identified specific prototype chain issues

2. Analysis Results:
   - Window prototype chain is incomplete
   - EventTarget exists but not in prototype chain
   - Event methods work but inheritance is broken
   - Impact: Found root cause of instanceof failure

Results:
- Window constructor and methods exist
- EventTarget constructor is available
- Event handling works functionally
- Prototype chain is missing EventTarget
- Window prototype is empty object

Analysis:
1. Prototype Chain Structure
   - Current chain: Window -> {} -> Object
   - Expected chain: Window -> EventTarget -> Object
   - Methods are copied but inheritance is broken
   - JSDOM setup needs modification

2. Event System Implementation
   - Event methods are correctly bound
   - Event dispatch works properly
   - EventTarget constructor works
   - Inheritance pattern needs fixing

Next Steps:
1. Modify setup.js to properly extend EventTarget
2. Add prototype chain verification to C001 tests
3. Document JSDOM inheritance requirements
4. Update test environment documentation
