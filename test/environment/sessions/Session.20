Focus: Enhanced EventEmitter Integration

Changes Made:
1. EventEmitter Configuration:
   - Enhanced configuration with improved error handling
   - Added proper method binding
   - Impact: Better error detection and handling

2. Window Object Setup:
   - Improved window object creation with proper prototype chain
   - Added comprehensive fallback methods
   - Added type safety checks
   - Impact: More robust window object initialization

Results:
- Implemented enhanced error handling
- Added proper method binding
- Improved prototype chain setup
- Root cause identified: Window prototype chain issues

Analysis:
1. Event System:
   - EventEmitter methods need proper binding
   - Error handling works as expected
   - Type safety improves reliability

2. Window Object:
   - Prototype chain still causing issues
   - Fallback methods working correctly
   - Type safety preventing undefined errors

Next Steps:
1. Fix Window prototype chain
2. Verify EventEmitter binding
3. Test all error cases
4. Document type safety requirements
