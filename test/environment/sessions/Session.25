Status: FAIL

Changes Made:
1. Simplified vitest.config.ts:
   - Disabled worker threads to avoid serialization issues
   - Removed beforeParse hook
   - Simplified JSDOM configuration options

2. Refactored setup.ts:
   - Directly extended window object with event methods
   - Used Object.defineProperties for proper method binding
   - Added debug logging for initialization verification
   - Simplified event emitter setup

Results:
- Debug logs show window object is properly initialized with event methods
- All tests are still failing with: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'on')"
- Error occurs in src/tests/setup.ts:115:1
- Window object methods are defined but become undefined during test execution

Analysis:
1. Event methods are correctly added to window object (verified by logs)
2. Methods become undefined at some point during test execution
3. Issue might be related to JSDOM resetting the window object
4. Need to investigate test lifecycle and window object persistence

Next Steps:
1. Add more debug logging around test lifecycle events
2. Investigate JSDOM window object lifecycle
3. Consider moving event method setup to beforeAll or beforeEach hooks
4. Review test environment setup order

Command used: npx vitest run
