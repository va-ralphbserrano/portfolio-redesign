Focus: Resolving event dispatch system failures in JSDOM environment

Changes Made:
1. Event System Core:
   - Implemented proper EventTarget inheritance chain
   - Added robust error handling for event operations
   - Improved event data handling with CustomEvent support
   - Added event listener cleanup mechanisms

2. Test Coverage:
   - Created comprehensive event.test.js
   - Added tests for binding, removal, and error cases
   - Implemented edge case handling tests
   - Added cleanup in afterEach hooks

3. Stability Tests:
   - Updated C005-event-dispatch.test.ts with new test cases
   - Added proper cleanup mechanisms
   - Implemented comprehensive event system validation
   - Error: No test suite found in stability test file

Results:
- Event system now properly inherits from EventTarget
- Event handlers maintain correct 'this' binding
- Error handling prevents test crashes
- Event cleanup prevents memory leaks
- Stability tests failing to execute

Analysis:
1. Event System Architecture
   - Previous implementation lacked proper inheritance
   - Event handler binding was inconsistent
   - Memory leaks possible without cleanup
   - Error handling was insufficient

2. Test Coverage
   - New test suite covers core functionality
   - Edge cases now properly handled
   - Cleanup mechanisms verified
   - Error scenarios tested

3. Stability Test Failure
   - Test file not being recognized by vitest
   - Possible module import or configuration issue
   - Need to verify test file format and setup

Next Steps:
1. Debug and fix stability test execution issues
2. Verify test file format and imports
3. Run full test suite after fixes
4. Update component tests to use new event system

Commands used: 
npx vitest run test/environment/event.test.js
npx vitest run test/environment/stability/event-system/C005-event-dispatch.test.ts
