Status: IN_PROGRESS

Focus: Improving window object initialization and event method binding for test environment stability

Changes Made:
1. Window Object Initialization:
   - Implemented proper Object.defineProperties for window object creation
   - Enhanced prototype chain inheritance from JSDOM window
   - Improved event method binding (on, off, emit)
   - Impact: Reduced TypeError occurrences but some instability remains

2. Event System Implementation:
   - Refined event handling architecture in test.environment.ts
   - Created custom window object with proper event method inheritance
   - Enhanced type safety for event methods
   - Error: TypeError in event method binding, reduced frequency

Results:
- Improved window object stability
- Reduced TypeError occurrences
- 47 test files still not executing
- Event method binding shows improvement but needs verification

Analysis:
1. Test Environment Stability
   - Window object initialization more reliable
   - Event system architecture improved
   - Configuration issues still affecting test discovery
   - Need to verify event binding across all test cases

2. Error Patterns
   - TypeError frequency reduced
   - Root cause partially addressed
   - Some initialization order issues remain
   - Event binding improvements showing positive impact

Next Steps:
1. Continue investigating remaining test failures
2. Complete verification of event method binding
3. Address remaining TypeError instances
4. Document new test failure patterns
5. Review JSDOM initialization sequence
