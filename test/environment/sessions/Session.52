Status: IN_PROGRESS

Focus: Converting Stability Tests to ESM and Running Test Suite

Changes Made:
1. C005-event-dispatch.test.ts Updates:
   - Converted to ESM syntax
   - Added proper type imports
   - Improved Window type extension
   - Impact: Complete ESM compatibility

2. Type System Improvements:
   - Using CustomWindow type consistently
   - Enhanced type safety in tests
   - Cleaner type declarations
   - Impact: Better type checking and safety

Test Results:
1. Test Suite Execution:
   - Command: npx vitest run
   - Status: Failed (47 test files)
   - Error: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'on')
   - Location: test/stability/setup.ts:43:1

2. Key Issues:
   - Event binding system not properly initialized
   - Window object undefined in setup.ts
   - Module loading issues in test environment
   - Type system integration incomplete

Analysis:
1. ESM Conversion Status
   - test.environment.ts 
   - setup.ts  (but has runtime issues)
   - C005-event-dispatch.test.ts 
   - Remaining: vitest.config.ts

2. Type System Integration
   - CustomWindow type properly shared
   - Event types consistently used
   - Window extension properly typed
   - Type safety improved

3. Runtime Issues
   - Event system initialization failing
   - Window object not properly extended
   - Module loading sequence needs review
   - Test environment setup incomplete

Next Steps:
1. Fix setup.ts window object initialization
2. Review event system binding sequence
3. Verify module loading order
4. Update vitest.config.ts for ESM
5. Document any new issues
6. Update issue tracker

Command used: npx vitest run
