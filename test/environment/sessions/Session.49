Session 49 - 2024-02-20
Status: IN_PROGRESS

Focus: Resolving C008 Module System Conflict

Changes Made:
1. Configuration Analysis:
   - Identified project uses ESM (type: "module" in package.json)
   - Found test files using CommonJS patterns
   - Located module resolution conflicts in vitest.config.ts
   - Impact: Clear understanding of module system mismatch

2. Issue Investigation:
   - Root cause: Mixed module systems (ESM vs CommonJS)
   - Path alias resolution affected by module type
   - Test discovery impacted by module patterns
   - Impact: Test environment instability

Results:
- Confirmed module system conflict as root cause
- Identified affected test files and configurations
- Found path resolution issues in test setup
- Prepared solution approach

Analysis:
1. Module System State
   - Project configured for ESM
   - Test files using CommonJS patterns
   - Path aliases not properly resolving
   - Mixed import patterns causing conflicts

2. Impact Assessment
   - Test discovery failing
   - Setup files not loading properly
   - Import statements failing
   - Path resolution inconsistent

Next Steps:
1. Update test files to use ESM syntax
2. Modify vitest.config.ts for proper module resolution
3. Update import statements in test files
4. Add ESM-specific test documentation

Command used: npx vitest run
