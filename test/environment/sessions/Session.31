Focus: Implementing Window object stability tests (C001)

Changes Made:
1. Test Implementation:
   - Created C001-window-stability.test.js
   - Implemented comprehensive Window object tests
   - Added event handling and prototype chain tests
   - Impact: Established baseline for Window object stability testing

2. Test Results:
   - 6 out of 7 tests passing
   - Failed: Window prototype chain integrity test
   - Error: window instanceof window.EventTarget returning false
   - Impact: Identified issue with Window object inheritance

Results:
- Verified basic Window object stability
- Confirmed event method binding
- Validated event context maintenance
- Successfully tested event handling under load
- Identified prototype chain issue

Analysis:
1. Window Object Structure
   - Basic properties and methods are stable
   - Event handling system functions correctly
   - Event listener management works as expected
   - Prototype chain needs investigation

2. Event System Findings
   - Event registration works properly
   - Event removal functions correctly
   - Event order is maintained under load
   - Event context binding is correct

Next Steps:
1. Investigate Window object prototype chain
2. Add EventTarget inheritance tests
3. Consider adding event bubbling tests
4. Document prototype chain requirements
