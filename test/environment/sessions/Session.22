### Session 22 (2024-01-17)
Status: FAIL
Changes:
- Ran tests with latest window object and event system setup
- Error persists: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'on')
- All 33 test files failing with same error pattern
- Location: src/tests/setup.ts:122:1

Analysis:
- Window object initialization still not properly handling event methods
- Error occurs before any tests can execute
- Critical issue: Event system binding failing at setup phase

Next Steps:
1. Review window object creation in setup.ts
2. Ensure proper method binding order
3. Add debug logging for window object state
4. Consider alternative event system approach
