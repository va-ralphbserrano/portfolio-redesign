Status: PASS

Focus: Establishing Test Stability Framework

Changes Made:
1. Stability Test Structure:
   - Created /stability directory structure
   - Added comprehensive README.md with guidelines
   - Established test categories (jsdom, core, integration)
   - Set up proper naming conventions and documentation standards

2. Initial Stability Test:
   - Created C001-window-object-persistence.test.js
   - Implemented comprehensive window object stability tests
   - Added proper test documentation and cross-referencing
   - Set up test lifecycle verification

3. Test Configuration:
   - Updated vitest.config.ts to include stability tests
   - Fixed test implementation to use Vitest instead of Jest
   - Improved event handler this binding

Results:
- Stability test structure established
- First critical test case (C001) implemented and passing
- Clear documentation and guidelines in place
- Directory structure ready for additional test cases
- All 4 window object stability tests passing

Analysis:
1. Test Organization
   - Clear separation of concerns (jsdom, core, integration)
   - Proper test case documentation format
   - Easy to extend structure for new cases

2. Test Coverage
   - Window object stability tests cover core functionality
   - Event system testing integrated
   - Lifecycle persistence verification added

3. Test Results
   - Window.on method persistence verified
   - Event listener preservation confirmed
   - Multiple event binding working correctly
   - Proper this binding maintained

Next Steps:
1. Implement C002 stability tests (JSDOM initialization)
2. Add event system stability tests (C003)
3. Run initial stability test suite
4. Document test results in TEST_ENVIRONMENT.md

Command used: npx vitest run ./test/environment/stability/jsdom/window/C001-window-object-persistence.test.js
