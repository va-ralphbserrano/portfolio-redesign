## Focus: Window Event System Binding Fix

## Changes Made
1. Event System Analysis:
   - Identified binding issues with window object
   - Analyzed class-based system limitations
   - Documented core problems
   - Impact: Clear understanding of issues

2. Implementation Attempts:
   - Tried various binding approaches
   - Tested different initialization methods
   - Explored alternative architectures
   - Impact: Better architectural understanding

## Results
- Identified core binding issues
- Documented system limitations
- Explored potential solutions
- Created plan for next steps

## Analysis
1. Event System:
   - Class-based approach problematic
   - Binding issues fundamental
   - Architecture needs rethinking

2. Window Object:
   - Complex initialization sequence
   - Method binding inconsistent
   - Property descriptors causing issues

## Next Steps
1. Consider EventEmitter approach
2. Simplify binding mechanism
3. Improve initialization
4. Add better error handling

## Command used: npx vitest run
