Session 33 - 2024-01-18
Status: IN_PROGRESS

Focus: Fix Window object prototype chain inheritance from EventTarget

Changes Made:
1. Environment Review:
   - Reviewed all session logs (1-32)
   - Cross-referenced TEST_ENVIRONMENT.md
   - Verified C001 priority in Solution Roadmap
   - Confirmed dependency chain: C001 -> [C002, C003]

2. Issue Analysis:
   - C001: Window object not properly inheriting from EventTarget
   - Impact: Event handling methods unavailable
   - Location: setup.js

Results:
- Completed Review Phase
- Identified critical inheritance chain issue
- Ready to implement prototype chain fix

Analysis:
1. Root Cause:
   - Window object initialization in JSDOM lacks proper prototype chain
   - EventTarget methods not accessible on window instance
   - Affects all event-related operations

2. Dependencies:
   - Blocks C002 (JSDOM Initialization)
   - Blocks C003 (Event Binding)
   - Must be resolved before M002 (EventEmitter)

Next Steps:
1. Modify setup.js to extend Window from EventTarget
2. Add prototype chain verification tests
3. Verify event method availability
4. Document changes in TEST_ENVIRONMENT.md
