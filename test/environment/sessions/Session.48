Status: IN_PROGRESS

Focus: Test Environment Structure Validation and Documentation Review

Changes Made:
1. Environment Structure Review:
   - Verified directory structure compliance
   - Confirmed presence of all required documentation files
   - Validated session log format and continuity

2. Documentation Audit:
   - Cross-referenced TEST_ENVIRONMENT.md with session logs
   - Verified issue tracking format compliance
   - Confirmed dependency graph accuracy

Results:
- Environment structure follows specified guidelines
- 47 existing session logs properly maintained
- Active issue tracking system in place
- Clear dependency graph and solution roadmap established

Analysis:
1. Current System State
   - Test environment is well-structured and actively maintained
   - Critical issues (C006-C009) require attention
   - Module system conflicts (C008) and JSDOM initialization (C009) are current priorities

2. Documentation Compliance
   - All files follow specified formatting guidelines
   - Cross-referencing system is working effectively
   - Issue tracking maintains proper ID conventions

Next Steps:
1. Address C008 (Module system conflict) as highest priority
2. Investigate C009 (Window.on undefined) dependencies
3. Review stability test cases for component mounting (C006)
