Session 35 - 2024-02-13
Status: IN_PROGRESS

Focus: Fix Window prototype chain inheritance from EventTarget (C001)

Changes Made:
1. Review Phase:
   - Reviewed Sessions 1-34
   - Cross-referenced TEST_ENVIRONMENT.md
   - Verified C001 priority in Solution Roadmap
   - Confirmed dependency chain: C001 -> C003 -> M002

2. Issue Analysis:
   - C001: Window prototype chain failing
   - Impact: Event system non-functional
   - Location: setup.js, test environment initialization

Results:
- Completed Review Phase following process guidelines
- Ready to implement prototype chain fix
- Test command to use: npx vitest run

Analysis:
1. Root Cause:
   - Window object not properly inheriting from EventTarget
   - Constructor handling needs revision
   - Property descriptors not properly set

2. Dependencies:
   - Blocks C003 (Event Binding)
   - Blocks M002 (EventEmitter)

Next Steps:
1. Fix Window constructor to properly extend EventTarget
2. Implement correct property descriptors
3. Add prototype chain verification tests
4. Document changes and run test suite
