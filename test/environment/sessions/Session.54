Focus: Window Object Event Method Binding and Test Environment Initialization

Changes Made:
1. Test Environment Updates:
   - Simplified window object creation
   - Added direct event method implementations
   - Removed unnecessary object creation layers
   - Impact: Cleaner but still failing

2. Setup.ts Modifications:
   - Updated window object assignment
   - Simplified global property definitions
   - Removed redundant property assignments
   - Impact: More direct but error persists

Test Results:
- Command: npx vitest run
- Status: Failed (47 test files)
- Duration: 34.75s
- Error: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'on')
- Location: test/stability/setup.ts:24:1

Analysis:
1. Window Object Initialization
   - Event methods properly defined
   - Window object creation simplified
   - Property assignment streamlined
   - Global object binding issue persists

2. Event System Status
   - Core methods (on, off, emit) implemented
   - Event listener tracking in place
   - Method binding approach improved
   - Global scope access still failing

3. Test Environment Setup
   - JSDOM initialization working
   - Custom window type properly defined
   - Event system implementation complete
   - Global object assignment needs review

Next Steps:
1. Review global object assignment in setup.ts
2. Verify window object prototype chain
3. Check JSDOM window object inheritance
4. Investigate global scope initialization

Command used: npx vitest run
