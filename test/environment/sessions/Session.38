Focus: Implementing component tests and stability fixes for Phase 1

Changes Made:
1. Component Testing:
   - Created test framework and cases
   - Impact: Validates core functionality
   - Error: TypeError in formatSupport
   Location: src/components/adaptive/AdaptiveImage.tsx:31:44

2. Event System:
   - Enhanced dispatch handling
   - Impact: Test reliability
   - Error: Failed to execute 'dispatchEvent' on 'EventTarget'
   Location: test/environment/stability/event-system/C005-event-dispatch.test.ts

3. DOM Stability:
   - Added element queries
   - Impact: Test reliability
   - Error: Unable to find elements with test IDs
   Location: src/components/common/adaptive/SmartLayout/SmartLayout.test.tsx

## Test Results (2024-02-14)

### Component Tests
- Total Tests: 60
  - Failed: 35
  - Passed: 25
  - Coverage: 42%

### Critical Failures
1. TypeError in formatSupport
   - Location: src/components/adaptive/AdaptiveImage.tsx:31:44
   - Impact: Image format detection failing
   - Resolution: Investigate format support function implementation

2. Event Dispatch System (C005)
   - Location: test/environment/stability/event-system/C005-event-dispatch.test.ts
   - Error: Failed to execute 'dispatchEvent' on 'EventTarget'
   - Impact: Event system stability compromised
   - Resolution: Verify JSDOM event handling setup

3. Element Query Issues
   - Location: src/components/common/adaptive/SmartLayout/SmartLayout.test.tsx
   - Error: Unable to find elements by test ID
   - Impact: Component testing reliability affected
   - Resolution: Add missing test IDs to components

### Next Steps
1. Fix formatSupport TypeError
   - Review format detection logic
   - Add error handling for unsupported formats

2. Resolve Event System
   - Verify JSDOM configuration
   - Implement event dispatch workarounds if needed

3. Element Queries
   - Audit components for test IDs
   - Document test ID conventions

4. Documentation
   - Update test coverage reports
   - Document any JSDOM limitations discovered

Analysis:
1. Event System Issues
   - Details: Event dispatch failing in JSDOM
   - Implications: Blocking C005 completion

2. Component Stability
   - Details: Element queries failing
   - Implications: Need proper test IDs

Next Steps:
1. Fix C005 event dispatch
2. Add missing test IDs
3. Resolve C004 stability
4. Run stability suite
