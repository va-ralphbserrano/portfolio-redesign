Session 27 - 2024-01-17
Status: COMPLETED

Focus: Phase 1 Completion - Chronological Review & Dependency Analysis

Changes Made:
1. Chronological Session Review:
   Session 1:
   - Initial setup
   - Issue I002: Test environment documentation (Fixed)
   
   Session 2:
   - First JSDOM attempt
   - Issue C002: JSDOM initialization inconsistent
   - Root: Missing proper window object setup
   
   Session 3:
   - Issue C001: Window.on undefined
   - Dependencies: Requires C002 to be fixed
   - Critical setup error in setup.ts
   
   Session 4:
   - Issue C003: Event handler binding fails
   - Issue M001: Test lifecycle cleanup incomplete
   - Dependencies: Both depend on C001
   
   Sessions 5-19:
   - Multiple attempts at window object setup
   - No new core issues, variations of C001-C003
   - Pattern: Each fix breaks another part
   
   Session 20:
   - Issue M002: EventEmitter persistence
   - Enhanced error handling attempt
   - Dependencies: Requires C001, C003
   
   Sessions 21-23:
   - Focused on event binding and window object
   - No new issues, attempting different approaches
   - Pattern: Methods defined but become undefined
   
   Session 24:
   - Issue I001: Worker thread serialization
   - BeforeParse hook attempt failed
   - Independent issue from core problems
   
   Session 25:
   - Simplified configuration
   - Core issues remain (C001, C003)
   - Demonstrates need for systematic approach

2. Issue Dependency Graph:
   ```
   [C002] JSDOM Init
      ↓
   [C001] Window.on undefined
      ↓
   ┌────────┴───────┐
   ↓                ↓
   [C003]           [M001]
   Event Binding    Cleanup
      ↓
   [M002]
   EventEmitter

   [I001] Worker Thread (Independent)
   [I002] Documentation (Resolved)
   ```

3. Key Patterns Identified:
   a) Window Object Lifecycle:
      - Initialization → Method Definition → Test Execution → Method Loss
   
   b) Error Propagation Chain:
      - JSDOM Setup → Window Object → Event Methods → Test Execution
   
   c) Solution Attempts Pattern:
      - Direct window modification
      - Prototype chain modification
      - Event system reimplementation
      - Configuration changes

4. Critical Path Analysis:
   1. C002 must be resolved first (JSDOM initialization)
   2. C001 depends on C002 (Window object stability)
   3. C003 and M001 can be addressed after C001
   4. M002 requires C003 to be fixed
   5. I001 can be addressed independently

Next Steps:
1. Begin Phase 2 with focus on C002
2. Prepare comprehensive fix for JSDOM initialization
3. Document all previous JSDOM approaches
4. Create test cases for JSDOM stability

Command used: None (Documentation & Analysis)
