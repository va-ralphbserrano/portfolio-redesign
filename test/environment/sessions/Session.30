Status: PASS

Focus: Implementing JSDOM initialization stability test (C002)

Changes Made:
1. Test Structure:
   - Created C002.test.js with proper ES module syntax
   - Implemented comprehensive JSDOM initialization tests
   - Added document load handling for stability
   - Impact: Established baseline for JSDOM stability testing

2. Configuration Adjustments:
   - Utilized global test functions from Vitest config
   - Maintained proper JSDOM import
   - Impact: Resolved test discovery and execution issues

Results:
- Successfully created and passed C002 stability test
- Verified JSDOM initialization stability
- Confirmed event handling capabilities
- Validated DOM manipulation functions
- Established proper cleanup procedures

Analysis:
1. Test Environment Setup
   - Global test functions work correctly with proper configuration
   - JSDOM requires explicit load handling for stability
   - Document readyState must be monitored for reliable testing

2. Stability Findings
   - JSDOM initialization is stable under load
   - Event handling system functions correctly
   - DOM manipulation operations work as expected

Next Steps:
1. Implement additional stability test cases
2. Add more comprehensive event handling tests
3. Consider adding performance benchmarks

Command used: npx vitest run stability/jsdom/lifecycle/C002.test.js
