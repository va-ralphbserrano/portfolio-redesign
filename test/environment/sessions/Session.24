### Session 24 (2024-01-17)
Status: FAIL
Changes:
- Enhanced JSDOM configuration in vitest.config.ts
- Added beforeParse hook for window object setup
- Added debug logging for window object state
- Error: DataCloneError - beforeParse(window) could not be cloned
- Location: node:internal/per_context/domexception:53:5

Analysis:
- JSDOM beforeParse hook is not serializable
- Worker thread serialization issues with window object
- Debug logging shows window object initialization attempt
- Possible conflict between worker threads and JSDOM setup

Next Steps:
1. Remove worker threads and run tests in single thread
2. Simplify JSDOM configuration
3. Move window object setup to setup.ts
4. Consider alternative approach without beforeParse hook
