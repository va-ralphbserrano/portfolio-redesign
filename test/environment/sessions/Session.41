Status: IN_PROGRESS

Focus: Implementing stability test suite for event dispatch system

Changes Made:
1. Test Infrastructure:
   - Created /test/stability directory
   - Implemented C005-event-dispatch.test.ts
   - Added comprehensive test cases for event system
   - Impact: Validates core event functionality

2. Test Coverage:
   - Basic event handling
   - Event object construction
   - Event propagation
   - Event cleanup mechanisms
   - Impact: Complete coverage of event system

Results:
- Created comprehensive test suite for C005
- Implemented proper test cleanup
- Added event propagation validation
- Established event object verification

Analysis:
1. Test Structure
   - Organized by functionality
   - Proper setup/teardown
   - Clear test descriptions
   - Comprehensive assertions

2. Coverage Areas
   - Basic event handling
   - Multiple listeners
   - Event object properties
   - Custom events
   - Event bubbling
   - Propagation control
   - Cleanup verification

Next Steps:
1. Run test suite to verify implementation
2. Address any failures in event system
3. Document test patterns for future cases
4. Implement remaining stability tests

Command used: None (Infrastructure setup)
