Session 43 - 2024-01-08
Status: IN_PROGRESS

Focus: Test directory structure reorganization and discovery fixes

Changes Made:
1. Test Structure Analysis:
   - Found duplicate test directories
   - Identified conflicting test setups
   - Located multiple stability test locations
   - Impact: Test discovery confusion

2. Directory Organization:
   - Moving stability tests to unified location
   - Consolidating test setup files
   - Standardizing test patterns
   - Impact: Better test organization

Results:
- Identified test structure issues
- Found conflicting stability test locations
- Discovered setup file duplication
- Located test configuration conflicts

Analysis:
1. Directory Structure
   - Multiple test root directories (/test and /src/tests)
   - Duplicate stability test folders
   - Scattered test setup files
   - Inconsistent test patterns

2. Configuration Impact
   - Test discovery affected by split structure
   - Setup files not properly referenced
   - Path resolution issues
   - Import conflicts

Next Steps:
1. Move all stability tests to /test/stability
2. Consolidate test setup files
3. Update vitest configuration
4. Document test structure guidelines

Command used: None (Directory analysis)
