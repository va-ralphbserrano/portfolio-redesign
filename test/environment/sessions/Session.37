Focus: Implementing event system stability tests for C003

Changes Made:
1. Test Implementation:
   - Created C003-event-binding.test.js
   - Impact: Enables validation of event system
   - Error: None

2. Test Coverage:
   - Added event dispatch verification
   - Impact: Ensures proper event propagation
   - Error: None

Results:
- Test suite created successfully
- Initial test framework in place
- Ready for implementation phase

Analysis:
1. Test Structure:
   - Details: Framework follows C001 pattern
   - Implications: Consistent test organization

2. Coverage Planning:
   - Details: Identified key test scenarios
   - Implications: Will provide complete coverage

Next Steps:
1. Implement event binding tests
2. Add error case coverage
3. Document test results
4. Update issue tracker
