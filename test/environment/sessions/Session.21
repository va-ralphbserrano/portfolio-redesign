## Focus
Window Object Event System Refinement

## Changes Made
### Analysis
1. Identified specific location of event binding failure (setup.ts:219)
2. Analyzed window object creation and event system implementation
3. Documented critical issues in prototype chain and method binding
4. Impact: Clear understanding of binding issues

### Planning
1. Created comprehensive refactor plan
2. Identified key areas for modification
3. Impact: Clear path forward for fixes

## Results
- Located exact point of failure
- Documented binding mechanism issues
- Created detailed refactor plan
- Prepared for implementation

## Analysis
### Event System
1. Event binding fails at specific point
2. Method binding sequence incorrect
3. Prototype chain needs restructuring

### Implementation Strategy
1. Need to modify binding sequence
2. Require proper prototype setup
3. Must maintain method context

## Next Steps
1. Implement binding sequence changes
2. Fix prototype chain setup
3. Add proper error handling
4. Test modifications

## Command Used
npx vitest run
