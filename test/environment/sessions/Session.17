Focus: Class-based Event System Implementation

Changes Made:
1. Event System Refactor:
   - Created WindowEventSystem class
   - Added event method implementations
   - Added type definitions
   - Impact: Better organized event system

2. Integration Changes:
   - Modified window object creation
   - Added class instance binding
   - Improved error handling
   - Impact: More structured integration

Results:
- Created class-based system
- Implemented core methods
- Added type safety
- Identified binding issues

Analysis:
1. Event System:
   - Class structure works well
   - Methods properly defined
   - Binding still problematic

2. Window Object:
   - Integration needs work
   - Type safety improved
   - Property issues remain

Next Steps:
1. Fix binding issues
2. Improve window integration
3. Add more error checks
4. Test all scenarios
