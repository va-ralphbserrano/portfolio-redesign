### Session 23 (2024-01-17)
Status: FAIL
Changes:
- Implemented direct window object initialization
- Added debug logging for event method presence
- Removed proxy-based approach
- Error persists: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'on')
- Location: src/tests/setup.ts:130:1

Analysis:
- Debug logs show event methods are successfully added to window object
- Methods are present but still inaccessible during test execution
- Window object may be getting reset after initialization
- Possible JSDOM environment conflict

Next Steps:
1. Check JSDOM configuration in vitest.config.ts
2. Investigate window object lifecycle during test execution
3. Consider alternative event system implementation
4. Add more debug logging throughout test lifecycle
