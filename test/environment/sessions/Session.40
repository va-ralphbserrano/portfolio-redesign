Status: FAIL

Focus: Event dispatch and component test stability analysis

Changes Made:
1. Test Environment:
   - Ran vitest test suite
   - Identified multiple test failures across components
   - Found critical event dispatch issues

2. Test Failures Analysis:
   - Event Dispatch Issues:
     - Failed to execute 'dispatchEvent' on 'EventTarget'
     - Parameter 1 not of type 'Event'
   - Component Rendering:
     - Unable to find elements by data-testid
     - Missing ARIA attributes
   - State Management:
     - "Should not already be working" errors
     - Synchronization issues in async operations

Results:
- 42 files failed
- 35 tests failed
- 25 tests passed
- 15 uncaught errors during test run
- Multiple component test suites affected

Analysis:
1. Event System Issues
   - Event dispatch mechanism not properly initialized
   - Event object construction failing
   - Event binding inconsistencies

2. Component Testing Framework
   - Test setup not properly configured
   - Missing test environment initialization
   - React Testing Library integration issues

3. Critical Areas:
   - AdaptiveImage component tests
   - ResponsiveImage component tests
   - Performance test suite
   - Event handling tests

Next Steps:
1. Review event dispatch implementation in test setup
2. Fix event object construction in test environment
3. Address component mounting issues in test framework
4. Update test environment initialization process
5. Review and fix ARIA attribute handling

Command used: npx vitest run
