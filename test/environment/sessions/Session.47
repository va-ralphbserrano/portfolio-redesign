Focus: Window event handling initialization and type definitions

Changes Made:
1. Event System Initialization:
   - Added window.on/off/emit bindings
   - Updated type declarations
   - Fixed event method context binding
   - Error: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'on')

2. Type System Updates:
   - Added Window interface extensions
   - Synchronized with event system changes
   - Enhanced type safety for event methods

Results:
- All test suites failed (47 total)
- Window.on still undefined after bindings
- Test environment initialization issue persists
- Error Location: test/stability/setup.ts:44:1

Analysis:
1. Event System Integration
   - Window event methods not properly bound
   - Initialization order may be incorrect
   - JSDOM setup needs review

2. Process Compliance
   - Identified process violations
   - Corrected documentation approach
   - Aligned with test environment guidelines

Next Steps:
1. Review JSDOM initialization order
2. Verify window object is fully constructed before binding
3. Add debug logging to track object lifecycle
4. Consider alternative event binding approach
