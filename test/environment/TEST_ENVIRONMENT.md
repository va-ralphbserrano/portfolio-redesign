|-------|---------------------------|------------|-----------|------|-----------|
| C005  | Event dispatch failures   | Session 38 | Active    | -    | Partial fix |
| C006  | Component mounting issues | Session 40 | Active    | C005 | Event system |
| C007  | Test discovery           | Session 43 | Active    | -    | Module config |

Analysis:
- Window object initialization improved but still showing some instability
- Event method binding approach shows promise but needs further verification
- 47 test files still not executing, suggesting deeper configuration issues
- TypeError occurrences reduced but not eliminated

Next Steps:
1. Continue investigating remaining test failures
2. Verify event method binding across all test cases
3. Address remaining TypeError instances
4. Document any new patterns in test failures

Error: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'on')
Location: setup.ts:25, test.environment.ts:42
Impact: Reduced but persistent stability issues in test environment

## Next Actions
1. Review JSDOM initialization order
2. Add lifecycle debugging to window object setup
3. Consider alternative event binding approaches
4. Update test environment documentation
