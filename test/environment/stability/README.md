# Test Stability Cases

This directory contains test cases specifically designed to verify and maintain the stability of our test environment.

## Structure
```
/stability/
├── jsdom/              # JSDOM-specific stability tests
│   ├── window/         # Window object stability
│   ├── events/         # Event system stability
│   └── lifecycle/      # Test lifecycle stability
├── core/               # Core framework stability
└── integration/        # Integration stability
```

## Case Format
Each stability test case should follow this format:
```javascript
// [ID]-[category]-[description].test.js
// Example: C001-window-object-persistence.test.js

describe('[Category] - [Description]', () => {
    test('should maintain stability when [condition]', () => {
        // Arrange
        // Act
        // Assert
    });
});
```

## Categories

### Critical (C-series)
- Window object persistence
- JSDOM initialization consistency
- Event system reliability

### Major (M-series)
- Test lifecycle hooks
- Event emitter consistency
- Coverage tracking

### Infrastructure (I-series)
- Worker thread stability
- Resource cleanup
- Memory management

## Running Stability Tests
```bash
# Run all stability tests
npx vitest run ./test/environment/stability

# Run specific category
npx vitest run ./test/environment/stability/jsdom

# Run single test
npx vitest run ./test/environment/stability/jsdom/window/C001-window-object-persistence.test.js
```

## Adding New Cases
1. Identify the appropriate category
2. Create test file following naming convention
3. Document test purpose and expectations
4. Include relevant error cases
5. Cross-reference with TEST_ENVIRONMENT.md issues
