- Performance benchmarks MUST be met before deployment
- Security checks MUST pass all criteria
- Accessibility standards MUST be maintained (WCAG 2.1)
- All components MUST have TypeScript interfaces with JSDoc comments
- Test coverage MUST meet minimum thresholds

### Rule 3: Performance Standards
- Bundle size MUST not exceed defined limits

- Check for existing utilities, components, or services that could be extended
- Document any file or component reuse in the relevant documentation
- If creating a new file is necessary, document why existing solutions were insufficient
