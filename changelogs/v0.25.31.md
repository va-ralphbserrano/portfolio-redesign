# v0.25.31 - Performance Testing Infrastructure

## Added
- Comprehensive performance test suite with TypeScript support
- Mock plugins for Lighthouse, Web Vitals, and Resource Timing tests
- Custom TypeScript type definitions for performance metrics
- Test runner configuration with Playwright and ESBuild

## Changed
- Updated test configuration for better TypeScript support
- Improved type safety in test commands and plugins
- Enhanced test runner configuration with proper timeouts

## Fixed
- TypeScript compilation issues in test files
- Module loading complexities with test plugins
- Type inference challenges in test commands

## Technical Details
### Performance Test Suite
- Implemented Lighthouse performance metrics testing
- Added Web Vitals measurement checks
- Created resource timing and size budget tests

### Test Infrastructure
- Configured Web Test Runner with Playwright
- Added ESBuild for TypeScript support
- Implemented mock plugin architecture
- Enhanced type definitions and assertions

### Performance Budgets
- Scripts: ≤ 300KB
- Styles: ≤ 50KB
- Images: ≤ 2MB
- FCP: ≤ 2000ms
- LCP: ≤ 2500ms
- CLS: ≤ 0.1
- FID: ≤ 100ms
- TTFB: ≤ 600ms

## Next Steps
1. Implement actual performance measurements
2. Add more granular performance tests
3. Integrate with CI/CD pipeline
4. Expand cross-browser testing
5. Add error reporting and monitoring
