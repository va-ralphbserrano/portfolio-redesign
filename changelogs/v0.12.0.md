## Phase 2: Core Optimizations - Layout Components

### Layout Components
- Refactored into smaller files:
  * layout/types.ts: Type definitions and interfaces
  * layout/AnimatedLayout.tsx: Animation components
  * layout/Container.tsx: Container component
  * layout/Grid.tsx: Grid component
  * layout/Section.tsx: Section component
  * layout/Footer.tsx: Footer component
  * layout/Navbar.tsx: Navigation component
  * layout/index.ts: Public exports
