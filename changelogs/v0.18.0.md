## Phase 2: Core Optimizations - Project Data Organization

### Project Data Structure
- Split into focused modules:
  * data/types.ts: Type definitions
  * data/categories.ts: Project and certificate categories
  * data/projects.ts: Project data
  * data/certificates.ts: Certificate data
  * data/images.ts: Image imports
  * data/index.ts: Public exports
- Added comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
- Improved data organization
- Enhanced type safety
- Fixed type safety issues
- Improved code organization
- Enhanced maintainability
- Added proper type declarations
- Enhanced data organization

### Testing Status
- Project Data: âœ… All type checks passing
  * Type Definitions: âœ…
  * Categories: âœ…
  * Projects: âœ…
  * Certificates: âœ…
  * Image Imports: âœ…
